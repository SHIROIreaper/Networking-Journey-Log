# Networking Journey by Vyshnav PC

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal repo where Iâ€™m recording my learning journey towards computer networking and cybersecurity concepts, while exploring various tools and techniques.

---

## Overview

- Notes on networking concepts (IP addressing, DNS, OSI model, etc.)
- Hands-on labs using tools like Nmap, Ping, Traceroute, Wireshark
- Python scripts for basic automation
- Cheatsheets, command references, and more as I go

---

## Tools Iâ€™ll Focus for now

- "nmap", "ping", "traceroute", "whois" , "wireshark"
- Python for automation and scripting perhaps
- Linux terminal (my daily driver)

## Why This Repo?

Just to:
- Track my own progress
- Share mini-projects and tools I build
- Have fun while learning something cool

If youâ€™re also learning networking or just curious, feel free to explore or fork the repo!

> PS: This is a work in progress â€” Iâ€™ll keep adding to it whenever I learn something new or build something useful ðŸš€
